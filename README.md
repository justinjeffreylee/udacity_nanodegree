###Bikeshare Analysis
The provided dataset contains bike share information for January 2017 - June 2017
for three major cities - New York City, Chicago and Washington.  The code below 
helps the user select which set of data to analyze, shares a sampel of the raw
data to familiarize the user with the data structure, and then calculates helpful
statistics to understand the data.

###Features
Built in filters include by city, month and day.  Currently it is not possible
to view data for more than one city at a time. The calculated statistics fall 
into the following categories:
- Most Frequent Times of Travel
- Most Popular Bikeshare Stations
- Trip Duration
- User Statistics

###How to Use?
To use, load the file and then type main().

###Credits
Thanks to Udacity for the initial template to help point the way.
And of course, thanks to the ever helpful lifeline that is the internet, especially
Stack Overflow and the Python documentation!
